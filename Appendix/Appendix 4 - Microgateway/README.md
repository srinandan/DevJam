*Appendix 4 - Apigee Edge Microgateway*

Apigee Edge Microgateway is a secure, HTTP-based message processor for
APIs. Its main job is to process requests and responses to and from
backend services securely while asynchronously pushing valuable API
execution data/meta data to and from Apigee Edge.

Typically, Edge Microgateway is installed within a trusted network in
close proximity to backend target services; often, the μ-gateway will be
co-located on the same OS image as the target service. μGwy provides
enterprise-grade security, and some key plugin features such as spike
arrest, quotas, and so on. The μ-gateway leverages an Apigee Edge Public
Cloud instance, or an Apigee Edge private cloud (on premises)
installation for other aspects of API Management like analytics, and
developer management. You can install Edge Microgateway in the same data
center or even on the same machine as your backend services.

**Key features and benefits**

-   **Traffic management:** APIs proxied through Edge Microgateway never
    need to leave the perimeter of your corporate network. You get the
    Analytics and security capabilities of Apigee Edge public cloud,
    without sending your transaction data over public networks.

-   **Security:** Edge Microgateway authenticates requests with a signed
    bearer token or API key issued to each client app by Apigee Edge.
    This means you can secure your internal-to-internal APIs without
    writing new server-side code.

-   **Rapid deployment:** Unlike a full deployment of Apigee Edge, you
    can deploy and run an instance of Edge Microgateway within a
    matter of minutes.

-   **Network proximity:** You can install and manage Edge Microgateway
    in the same machine, subnet, or data center as the backend target
    APIs with which Edge Microgateway interacts. Same-machine proxy
    deployment means that proxied traffic does not incur additional
    network capacity, and does not require an additional VM. Super
    low footprint.

-   **Analytics:** Edge Microgateway asynchronously delivers API
    execution data to Apigee Edge, where it is processed by the Edge
    Analytics system. You can use the full suite of Edge Analytics
    metrics, dashboards, and APIs.

-   **Reduced latency:** All proxy activity is done on the local
    datacenter network, meaning the overhead of the proxy is very
    very low. All communication with Apigee Edge is asynchronous and
    does not happen as part of the client request pipeline. This
    allows Edge Microgateway to collect API data and send it to Apigee
    Edge without affecting latency of the runtime transactions.

**Why use Edge Microgateway?**

Moving the API management component close to backend target applications can 
reduce network latency. While you can install Apigee Edge on-premises in a 
private cloud, a full deployment of Apigee Edge is necessarily large and 
complex to support its full feature-set and data-heavy features like key 
management, monetization, and analytics. This means that deploying Apigee 
Edge on premises in each data-center is not always desirable.

With Edge Microgateway, you get a relatively small footprint application 
running close to your backend applications. And, you get to leverage full 
Apigee Edge for analytics, security, and other features.

***Simplest deployment scenario***

![](./media/image01.png)

This architeture shows the request processing path when Edge Microgateway is 
deployed in its most simple possible configuration, where Edge Microgateway 
and the backend target APIs are installed on the same machine.

For more deployment options please refer [here](http://docs.apigee.com/microgateway/content/edge-microgateway-overview)

**Objectives**

In this lab you will go through configuring, get working Edge
Microgateway installation capable of processing an API. You'll make
several secure, test API calls through Edge Microgateway to the API's
backend service and see how Apigee Edge processes analytics data from
Edge Microgateway.

The following credentials are required to start edge micro

key: xxxxx

secret: xxxx

edgemicro configuration complete!
```

-   **Copy the** Key, Secret and vault info, for later parts of
    the exercise.

-   Using the key and secret you just viewed; verify that the edge micro
    is configured correctly with the Edge Cloud org.

```
./edgemicro verify -o <org-name> -e <env-name> -k
<key> -s <secret>
```

You should see happy messages. If not, you'll need to stop, and
diagnose.

***Start the Edge Micro agent***

-   Before continuing, open a separate terminal window. This is where
    > the agent server will run.

-   cd to the agent directory.  
```
cd ../../agent
``` 

-   Execute this command to start the server:  
```
npm start  
```

    You will see an output from that command:   

```
> edgemicro-agent@1.1.1 start
C:\\Users\\nanda\\Documents\\apigee-edge-micro-1.1.1\\agent

> node build/src/index.js

i edge micro agent listening on 9000 
```

The configuration done so far allows Edge Microgateway to bootstrap
itself to Apigee Edge. The Edge Microgateway agent manages this
bootstrapping process, which kicks off whenever you start or restart
Edge Microgateway. After the bootstrapping succeeds, Edge Microgateway
retrieves a payload of additional configuration information from Apigee
Edge.

### Create a passthrough API Proxy

Log in to your organization on Apigee Edge.

-   Select APIs > API Proxies from the top menu.
-   In the API Proxies page, click + API Proxy.
-   In the dialog, configure the proxy as follows: 
    -   Starting Point Type: **Backend Service**
    -   Backend Service
        > URL: http://api.usergrid.com/{org-name}/sandbox/hotels

    -   Name: edgemicro\_{your\_initials}\_hotels
    -   Project Base Path: /{your-initials}/v1/mghotels
    -   Description: Edge Micro Proxy that will run locally to the
        node.js service
    -   Features: None

> ![](./media/image10.png)

**Note:** Edge μ-gateway-aware proxy names must always begin with the
prefix **edgemicro\_**

-   Click on Build to build and deploy the proxy

-   Once the proxy has been deployed, click on the Close button

-   Click on the Save button to save and deploy the changes to
    the hotels API Proxy

-   We have created an API Proxy that will be fetched by Edge Micro
    gateway, when it starts locally

-   Add the API Proxy you created edgemicro\_<your
    initials>\_mghotels to the API Product <your initials>
    Hospitality Basic Product

    -   From the Apigee Edge Management UI, go to Publish → API Products
    -   Select the API Product: <your initials> Hospitality Basic
        Product
    -   Click on Edit Button on the top right
    -   Click on + API Proxy button and API Proxy edgemicro\_<your
        initials>\_mghotels 

***Start Edge Microgateway***

-   Open a new terminal window (not the one where the agent is running)
    and print out help info for the agentproc command. We're going to
    use the -c, -k, and -s options to start Edge Microgateway.

```
Linux/Mac: ./edgemicro agent proc –h
Windows: node edgemicro agent proc -h
```

**Note:** The tutorial assumes that the cli/bin directory is in your
PATH. If you do not put it in your PATH, then you need to execute CLI
commands from the cli/bin directory (cd ../cli/bin and run ./edgemicro
agent proc -h).

-   Start Edge Microgateway by executing the following command,
    providing the key and secret values with the -k and -s
    parameters, respectively.
```
Linux/Mac: ./edgemicro agent proc -c start -k <key> -s
<secret>

Windows: node edgemicro agent proc –c start –k <key> -s
<secret>
```

-   If the micro gateway is started successfully, you will see something
    like the following console output:
```
{ "pid": 9104, "uid": "MTQ0NzQ1MjU4Nzk0MQ", "running": "true",
"restarts": 0, "since": "2015-11-13T22: 09: 47.959Z" }
```

**Note:** The **UID** is the unique id for this instance of Edge
Microgateway. You use this ID when retrieving log and monitoring
information about Edge Microgateway. See the *Edge Microgateway
Administrator*'s Guide for more information.

**Agent output:** In the terminal where the agent is running, you'll
see output like this. You may have to scroll up through the terminal
output to see some of the messages.
```

```

At this point, the agent retrieves a payload of Edge Microgateway
configuration information from Apigee Edge. This information includes:

-   ![](./media/image13.png)
    The public key we created and
    stored previously in the Apigee vault.

-   ![](./media/image12.png)
    A JSON representation of all Edge
    Microgatewayaware proxies that exist in
    the organization/environment. These are all proxies that are named
    with the prefix edgemicro\_.

-   ![](./media/image16.png)
    A JSON representation of all of
    the API products that exist in the organization.

With this information, Edge Microgateway knows which proxies and proxy
paths are allowed. If/when configured, it uses the product information
to enforce security (in the same way as any API proxy does on Apigee
Edge, where developer app keys have an association with products).
We'll go through the steps to secure Edge Microgateway shortly.

-   To test our API Proxy, call the
```
curl -i http://localhost:8000//{your-initials}/v1/mghotels
```

-   If you will see an authorization error, your Micro Gateway is
    listening for the API you have configured in the previous step

```
{"error":"missing\_authorization","error\_description":"Missing
Authorization header"}
```

-   Run the following command to get the JWT Token
```
curl -i -X POST "http://<org
name>-test.apigee.net/edgemicro-auth/token" \\ -H
"Content-Type:application/json" \\ -d '{ "grant\_type":
"client\_credentials", "client\_id":"...CLIENT\_ID\_HERE...",
"client\_secret": "...CLIENT\_SECRET\_HERE..." }'
```

The response you see will have a very long string, looking something
like so:

```
"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLc9.eyJhcHBsaWNhdGlvbl9u....kkBnE40jk\_2trmZkP6uf4-mcgUw91-qKofaw"
```

-   Make the API Call with a bearer token you received in the step above

```
curl -i -H "Authorization:Bearer VERY\_LONG\_JWT\_TOKEN\_HERE"
http://localhost:8000/{your-initials}/v1/weather/forecast?zipcode=95113
```


-   You should see the response json:
    ```
     {
     "action" : "get",
     "application" : "5d4057c0-3ace-11e5-9fd6-0dff5edbe5ab",
     "params" : { },
     "path" : "/hotels",
     "uri" : "https://api.usergrid.com/ssridhar/sandbox/hotels",
     "entities" : \[ {
     "uuid" : "7d20227a-5c82-11e5-a131-a7fee2bde904",
     "type" : "hotel",
     "name" : "MotifÃ‚ Seattle",
     "created" : 1442415121943,
     "modified" : 1442415121943,
     "address1" : "1415 5th Ave",
     "airportCode" : "SEA",
     "amenityMask" : 7798786,
      ……
    }
    ```

You have used the credentials you received from your Edge org on cloud
and you have used them on your local Micro Gateway. You are able to
manage your APIs centrally, while the enforcement is happening locally.

Summary
-------

That completes this hands-on lesson. In this lesson you learned about
setting up an Edge Micro Gateway, creating an API Proxy and
corresponding life cycle on your Edge org. You now have a fully
functioning and secure Edge Microgateway that can run your APIs locally,
picking up the security credentials from your Edge org.
